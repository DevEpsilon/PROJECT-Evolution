            <h2>ITAM Department</h2>
            <p>CWU was one of the first educational institutions that have reached out to the Evolution Team. With the rising cost of electronics and the dependency on having to use an electronic device for both work and educational purposes, having a device that can be customized based on the users needs students, faculty & staff don't have to worry about spending valuable money for something that won't last as long as Evolution.

            <p>Bank of America became a founder of the project not by us going to them, but rather they ran into the dilemma that we are offering to solve. Bank of America, or BOA for short, wanted devices that can quickly and easily be set up for their employees and their security needs. With our unique product offers, they have now supplied every employee in the company with their own specified laptop components and they love it! </p>

            <p>Project Evolution was on shark tank! We became a quickly grown company and needed more help on deck. Kevin O'Leary became our supporter, helping with the sales and distribution of our products for low equity of 3%. As he continued our growth, he wanted to change his daily driver to an Evolution Laptop, and now all of his business use us!

            <h2></h2>
            <p>With the rapid rate Evolution has been growing, many companies reached out to us. Vanguard Investments is one of those groups. They reached out to us because they wanted a "piece of the pie". Vanguard Investments offered to cover company costs for a small equity cost as well. Because of this more products are being delivered to users and pre-orders have been closed due to the overload of users signing up.
